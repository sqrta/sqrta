Nowadays, many teachers prefer to share their own political views with students. I am against with these 
behaviours. It will actually do harm to the education for students.

First, it may cause arguments and conflicts between students and teachers. The confliction may even be upgraded
 to violent crime. There was a crime in our city last year. A teacher in the mid school near my community was 
 shot by his student. He had given a class about the history of gun control in USA and shared his political view
 with his students. A student's completely different idea cause argument between the teacher and himself. They had
 a huge argument and the furious student took a gun the next day and shot his teacher.
